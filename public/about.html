  Hi, or should I say hello, everyone. I am Jonathan Handoyo, but I go with Jo or Jonathan. 
  I am more a pro gamer than a programmer and a second-year student at Edmonds Community College, located in a so-called rain city, Seattle. 
  Programming is really part of my daily life, mostly because of assignments, and sometimes I am working on my personal project when I am in the mood. 
  If you don't see me sitting in front of my monitors, there are 80% chance that I am jumping around at nearest badminton court.

  I was born in Mataram and grew up in Sumbawa, Indonesia, where my family runs an agriculture supply store. 
  I spent much of my childhood surrounded by farmers, seeds, and cornfields. My dad always says we can live without anything but food, and corn is a main source of food in the world and somehow, that stuck with me. 
  Growing up in a region where farmers work incredibly hard yet often produce less than their counterparts abroad, I became motivated to help improve agriculture through technology.

  My parents worked tirelessly to give me opportunities they never had, and their hope is that I can use what I learn to help people in my hometown. 
  That motivation is what led me to computer science. I still remember the first time I wrote a small program in high school to help solve a Newton's Law problem. 
  Clicking “run” and watching the computer bring my idea to life was an unforgettable moment. 
  I knew then that coding could become a tool to create real change.  Although that news says the tech industry has no more market available, I disagree. 
  On the island where I grew up, almost 50% of the residents don't even have a phone, let alone a computer. 
  As someone who lives based on the farmers' spending on seeds and pesticides, I feel like I have the responsibility to give something in return. 
  I believe when I graduate with a computer science major, I could create something that could improve their life quality. At least that is something that I can give back in return.

<p>
  Right now, I am wrapping up my college season and currently spending some of my time writing personal insights and essays for universities. 
  I don't put my hope too high, because this major is so competitive, but being accepted into the top 20 computer science universities in the US would be nice. 
  Also, this site is part of my personal project that I've been working on for the last few months. 
  I have a lot of personal project ideas that I want to work on, but I think I will decorate this website until I feel it is appropriate enough to be called one before moving on to another idea.

  And so, as every journey begins, there must be an end. 
  I want to thank you for reading my short story. Have a wonderful day wherever you are, and ciao!

        <li><a href="../index.html"><h2>Jonathan's Personal Website</h2></a></li>
        <p>
            Jonathan's personal website is a website personalized for Jonathan's personal needs, such as to showcase
            projects that Jonathan is working on or about to start. This website is still very young, created
            for Jonathan to learn web development. Many of the web pages are still very outdated and have no style that makes them look like 
            an actual website. However, the website is updated almost every week, every time Jonathan learns a new concept.
            So, stay tuned and see how this website and Jonathan's knowledge grow over tim <br/>
            The current timeline is:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1. 7th January: Enhance CSS layout and bootsrap used to style the main page and create dynamic display throughout any devices</li>
            <li>2. 31st January: All webpages such as Contact me, and Resume styled with CSS</li>
            <li>3. 28th February: Work in Progress page styled using CSS and updated with the lastest update log</li>
        </ul>
        <a href="../index.html"><img src="../assets/images/personal-web.png" alt="Photo of Jonathan's Personal Website" height="700"/></a>
        <li><h2>Book Ranking Website</h2></li>
        <p>
            As Jonathan is starting to read actual self-improvement and professional skills books, 
            Jonathan loves to rank the books to provide recommendations for the reader when looking for inspiration. 
            However, this idea is still under consideration and in the middle of brainstorming. The current plan is to 
            initialize this page by 1st February and finish it before June 2026.
